Implementation of a graph data structure
There is a Graph interface that defines all of the methods to implement in the GraphMatrix data structure. Methods available include bfs, topological sort, if there is a path between two nodes, as well as setters and getters for edges and weights. The GraphMatrix is implemented using a 2D matrix. 
Included in this repository is also the implementation of a HashTable using a HashSet. The HashTable has methods such as findSumPair which finds two values in the table that sum to a target value. The second method available is DistinctValues, which returns the number of unique values in the HashTable.
